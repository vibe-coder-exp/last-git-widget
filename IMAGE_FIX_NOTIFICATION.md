# Image Rendering Implementation Plan Notification

I have confirmed that the widget only displays URLs as text links. I have created a detailed plan `implementation_plan_images.md` to update the `formatMessage` function.

This update will automatically detect any URL ending in:
- .jpg
- .png
- .gif
- .webp

And render it as an actual image inside the chat bubble.

Please review `implementation_plan_images.md` and let me know if I should proceed.
